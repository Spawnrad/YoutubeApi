Here is an example:

$youtube = new Youtube();

// Authentication with encrypted certificate
$youtube->authenticate(
    'ServiceAuth',
    ['cert_file' => 'my_google_certificate', 'email' => 'myemail_for_google_service@googleapi_etc.com']
);

// The info variable will contains an array of data returned by google
$info = $youtube->api('video')->findVideoById('RnpyRe_7jZA');

> For now all APIs are compatible with all authentications.
